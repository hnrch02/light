# [Light](https://github.com/hnrch02/light)

Light is a browser- and extension independent skin for GitHub which aims at taking away some visual weight of GitHub's interface.

# Usage

I, personally, use light in conjunction with [dotcss](https://github.com/stewart/dotcss), but light is nothing more than a stylesheet, so it will work with whatever floats your boat.
